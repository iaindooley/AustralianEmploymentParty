                            <p>Once you learn these things, there are several fiscal policy outcomes, but the primary one is that the Australian Federal Government is free to pursue a policy of full employment.</p>

                            <p>That means that anyone who wants to work, can have a job.</p>

                            <p>This is NOT a "work for the dole" proposal. This is voluntary, full time employment, guaranteed by the government. The details of how to implement a programme of full employment are long and complex, but as recently as March 2016 the Australian Labor Party has pledged a return to full employment so it's not some crackpot theory.</p>

                            <p>Currently in Australia almost EVERY policy decision is discussed in the context of affordability. Rather, it should be discussed in the context of inflation. When you frame the discussion about economic policy this way, you realise that the government could dramatically increase spending WITHOUT having to hike taxes or "create savings" in other areas.</p>

                            <p>When morality is mixed with politics, the policy outcomes are inconsistent, reactionary and destructive.</p>

                            <p>If a someone believes something is morally right, then it's not the government's job to impose the morality of another section of society upon them by prohibiting them from engaging in that behaviour unless it infringes upon the rights of others.</p>

                            <p>The government's job as an ethical authority is to provide a legal structure within which people can live their life and do business in line with their moral choices, without harming each other.</p>

                            <p>In short, the role of government is to protect people from each other, not from themselves.</p>

                            <p>From this simple premise, a range of sensible policy can be derived.</p>

                            <p>The level of detail required to formulate policy detailed enough to be tabled within parliament is beyond the scope of what we can produce as a party at this stage, but we are confident that the same framework can be applied equally well at that level of complexity and detail.</p>

                            <p>Modern Monetary Theory tells us that a government who issues its own currency, and issues debt only in that currency, can never go broke. The concern is when developing nations take on debt denominated in, for example, US dollars. In that case they can't just create more dollars to make repayments, they have to GET the dollars first. This puts them in a very desperate situation.</p>

                            <p>Correspondingly, we think that, rather than cancelling debt issued by developing nations, the debts should simply be exchanged to be in the sovereign currency of that government. This would enable them to easily make interest repayments and would then promote investment from those countries that would then hold large sums of that sovereign currency.</p>
